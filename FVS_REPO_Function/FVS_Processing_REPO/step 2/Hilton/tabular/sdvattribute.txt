58|"Yields of Irrigated Crops (Component)"|"cocropyld"|"irryield_r"|"Float"||2|"These are the estimated average yields per acre that can be expected of selected irrigated crops under a high level of management. In any given year, yields may be higher or lower than those indicated because of variations in rainfall and other climatic factors. It is assumed that the irrigation system is adapted to the soils and to the crops grown, that good-quality irrigation water is uniformly applied as needed, and that tillage is kept to a minimum.

In the database, some states maintain crop yield data by individual map unit component and others maintain the data at the map unit level. Attributes are included in this application for both, although only one or the other is likely to have data for any given geographic area. This attribute uses data maintained at the map unit component level.

The yields are actually recorded as three separate values in the database. A low value and a high value indicate the range for the soil component. A ""representative"" value indicates the expected value for the component. For these yields, only the representative value is used.

The yields are based mainly on the experience and records of farmers, conservationists, and extension agents. Available yield data from nearby areas and results of field trials and demonstrations also are considered.

The management needed to obtain the indicated yields of the various crops depends on the kind of soil and the crop. Management can include drainage, erosion control, and protection from flooding; the proper planting and seeding rates; suitable high-yielding crop varieties; appropriate and timely tillage; control of weeds, plant diseases, and harmful insects; favorable soil reaction and optimum levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and trace elements for each crop; effective use of crop residue, barnyard manure, and green manure crops; and harvesting that ensures the smallest possible loss.

The estimated yields reflect the productive capacity of each soil for the selected crop. Yields are likely to increase as new production technology is developed. The productivity of a given soil compared with that of other soils, however, is not likely to change."|||"Property"||||0|1|0|0||1|||1|"IrrYldCo"||"cropname"|"Choice"|"Crop"|"yldunits"|"Choice"|"Yield Units"|0|||||0|||"Weighted Average"|1|1||1|3|5|"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""3""><ColorRampType type=""1"" name=""Progressive"" count=""3""><LowerColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><LowerColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><LowerColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><UpperColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""255"" /></ColorRampType><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0"" classes=""5"" /></Map_Legend>"|1|04/26/2007 07:13:43|"Weighted Average"||1|"Float"

Units are cubic feet per acre per year. This is called the ""culmination of mean annual increment"" (CMAI).

Mean annual increment (MAI) is the average yearly wood volume growth per acre of a stand. This is computed by dividing the total wood volume by the stand age. As the stand increases in age, the MAI also increases until tree-to-tree competition and physiological maturity reduce the rate of increase. The point when a stand reaches its maximum MAI is called the ""culmination of mean annual increment"" (CMAI).

2660|"Minnesota Crop Productivity Index"|"mutext"|"text"|"Narrative Text"|||"The Minnesota Crop Productivity Index (CPI) ratings provide a relative ranking of soils based on their potential for intensive row crop production.  An index can be used to rate the potential yield of one soil against that of another over a period of time.  Ratings range from 0 to 100.  The higher numbers indicate higher production potential.

The CPI ratings do not take into account climatic factors, such as the differences in precipitation or growing degree days across Minnesota.  The ratings are based on physical and chemical properties of the soils and on such hazards and flooding and ponding.  Available water capacity, reaction (pH), slopes, soil moisture status, cation-exchange capacity (CEC), organic matter content, salinity, and surface fragments are the major properties evaluated when CPI ratings are generated.  The soil properties selected are those that are important for the production of corn.

All map units in Minnesota were initially evaluated using the Cropland Productivity rule in the National Soil Information System (NASIS).  They were assigned a value using an overall CPI based on the combined properties and characteristics of the map unit as a whole, and the values were adjusted based on tacit knowledge of local experts.  An individual map unit (for example, Canisteo clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes) will have the same CPI value wherever that map unit occurs throughout the state.

When the soils are rated, the following assumptions are made:  a) adequate management, b) no irrigation, c) artificial drainage where required, d) no land leveling or terracing, and e) no climatic factors considered. 

The map unit CPI was used to update the map unit crop yields for corn and soybeans.  Even through predicted average yields will change with time, the productivity indices are expected to remain relatively constant in relation to one another over time."|||"Property"||||0|0|0|0||0|||-1|"MNCPI"|"textcat='CropProd'"|||||||0|||||0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|4||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""4"">

526|"Soil-Based Residential Wastewater Disposal Ratings (VT)"|"mapunit"|"vtsepticsyscl"|"Choice"|254||"This interpretation indicates the suitability of the soils for soil-based residential wastewater disposal systems. The ratings are based on the 2007 Vermont Environmental Protection Rules (Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, Agency of Natural Resources). This rating system replaces the system in the publication ""Ancillary Soil Interpretation Ratings for On-site Sewage Disposal in Vermont,"" published in January 1997 by the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

Included in soil-based wastewater disposal systems are absorption fields, also known as leach fields, or trenches in which effluent from a septic tank is distributed into the soil through subsurface tiles or perforated pipe. There must be unsaturated soil material beneath the absorption field to filter the effluent effectively. Unsatisfactory performance, including excessively slow absorption of effluent, surfacing of effluent, and hillside seepage, can affect public health.

The ratings are represented by symbols for five interpretive groups and their subgroups. These groups and subgroups are described in the following paragraphs.

Group I soils are well suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems. Good performance and low maintenance can be expected. The soils in this group are sandy and gravelly soils that formed in outwash and that have rapid permeability in the substratum and well drained soils that formed in till and that have a friable substratum with moderate permeability. Slopes generally are less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Ia have rapid permeability and slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Ib have rapid permeability and slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Ic have moderate permeability and slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Id have moderate permeability and slopes that range to more than 20 percent.

Group II soils are moderately suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems. This group includes soils with moderately slow to very slow permeability; complexes in which one or more of the soils have bedrock at a moderate depth (20 to 40 inches); soils that would qualify for inclusion in group I but have slopes of more than 20 percent; and soils that have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 18 inches or more.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIa have moderately slow to very slow permeability and slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIb have moderately slow to very slow permeability and have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIc have bedrock at a moderate depth (20 to 40 inches) in some areas and have slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IId have bedrock at a moderate depth (20 to 40 inches) and have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIe have rapid permeability and have slopes of more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIf have moderate permeability and slopes of more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIh have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 18 inches or more and have slopes of less than 20 percent.

Group III map units are marginally suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems. Intensive onsite investigation may be needed to locate suitable areas, or special design, extra maintenance, or costly alteration may be needed to overcome the soil-related limitations. In areas where the water table is at a shallow depth, seasonal onsite monitoring of the water table may be needed to determine whether the site is suitable. Some areas of any of the map units in group III may not be suitable for soil-based wastewater disposal systems.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIa have bedrock at a depth of less than 10 inches in some areas. Some map units are limited by slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIb are subject to flooding and have a seasonal high water table at a moderate depth.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIc have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 foot or less and have slopes of 8 percent or less.
     •   	Map units in subgroup IIId have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 foot or less and have slopes of 8 to 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIe generally have a seasonal high water table within a depth of 2 feet and have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIf have a seasonal high water table and limited depth to bedrock. Some map units have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIg have a flooding hazard.

Group IV map units are generally not suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems because of such limitations as wetness, depth to bedrock, restricted permeability, and slope.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVa are subject to excessive wetness.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVb are limited by the depth to bedrock and by slopes of more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVc are generally not suited because of a very limited depth to bedrock and the slope.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVd have moderately slow to very slow permeability and have slopes of more than 20 percent. Some map units have a seasonal high water table.

Group V map units are not rated for soil-based wastewater disposal systems. This group includes miscellaneous areas that have been filled, excavated, regraded, or otherwise disturbed by human activities; areas that are mapped above the series level, such as Udorthents; and areas of water. The miscellaneous areas and the areas mapped above the series level have a wide range of soil properties. Onsite investigation is needed to determine the suitability of these areas for soil-based wastewater disposal.

These ratings are based on the installation of a new septic system for a new single-family home on a lot subdivided on or after June 14, 2002, in a municipality that has planning and zoning bylaws. The ratings do not necessarily apply to the siting of a replacement system for an existing residence. The ratings for lots subdivided before June 14, 2002, are based on a slope limitation of 30 percent, whereas the ratings in this interpretation are based on a slope limitation of 20 percent. The ratings in this interpretation do not take into consideration some site factors that can affect the placement of septic systems, such as wellhead and source protection areas, isolation distances, and the size of the parcel.
This interpretation is intended for general planning purposes only and is not intended to replace or supersede the need for an onsite soil investigation. These ratings apply only to land within the State of Vermont."|||"Property"||||1|0|0|0||0|||-1|"SBRWDR"||||||||0||||"Centimeters"|0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|2||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""2""><ColorRampType type=""2"" name=""Defined"" /><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0""><Labels value=""Ia"" label=""Ia"" order=""1""><Color red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Ib"" label=""Ib"" order=""2""><Color red=""44"" green=""188"" blue=""20"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Ic"" label=""Ic"" order=""3""><Color red=""27"" green=""118"" blue=""12"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Id"" label=""Id"" order=""4""><Color red=""187"" green=""239"" blue=""196"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIa"" label=""IIa"" order=""5""><Color red=""158"" green=""145"" blue=""50"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIb"" label=""IIb"" order=""6""><Color red=""239"" green=""250"" blue=""176"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIc"" label=""IIc"" order=""7""><Color red=""239"" green=""250"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IId"" label=""IId"" order=""8""><Color red=""166"" green=""197"" blue=""11"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIe"" label=""IIe"" order=""9""><Color red=""108"" green=""99"" blue=""34"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIf"" label=""IIf"" order=""10""><Color red=""214"" green=""194"" blue=""158"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIg"" label=""IIg"" order=""11""><Color red=""178"" green=""142"" blue=""76"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIh"" label=""IIh"" order=""12""><Color red=""175"" green=""113"" blue=""51"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIa"" label=""IIIa"" order=""13""><Color red=""245"" green=""153"" blue=""77"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIb"" label=""IIIb"" order=""14""><Color red=""232"" green=""113"" blue=""14"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIc"" label=""IIIc"" order=""15""><Color red=""189"" green=""92"" blue=""11"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIId"" label=""IIId"" order=""16""><Color red=""249"" green=""208"" blue=""153"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIe"" label=""IIIe"" order=""17""><Color red=""246"" green=""99"" blue=""8"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIf"" label=""IIIf"" order=""18""><Color red=""251"" green=""180"" blue=""137"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIg"" label=""IIIg"" order=""19""><Color red=""207"" green=""136"" blue=""117"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IVa"" label=""IVa"" order=""20""><Color red=""255"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IVb"" label=""IVb"" order=""21""><Color red=""243"" green=""150"" blue=""141"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IVc"" label=""IVc"" order=""22""><Color red=""190"" green=""93"" blue=""62"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IVd"" label=""IVd"" order=""23""><Color red=""226"" green=""96"" blue=""96"" /></Labels><Labels value=""V"" label=""V"" order=""24""><Color red=""220"" green=""48"" blue=""220"" /></Labels></Legend_Elements></Map_Legend>"|1|12/29/2011 07:52:58|"No Aggregation Necessary"||1|"Choice"
471|"Soil Taxonomy Classification"|"component"|"taxclname"|"String"|120||"This rating presents the taxonomic classification based on Soil Taxonomy.

The system of soil classification used by the National Cooperative Soil Survey has six categories (Soil Survey Staff, 1999 and 2003). Beginning with the broadest, these categories are the order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family, and series. Classification is based on soil properties observed in the field or inferred from those observations or from laboratory measurements. This table shows the classification of the soils in the survey area. The categories are defined in the following paragraphs.

ORDER. Twelve soil orders are recognized. The differences among orders reflect the dominant soil-forming processes and the degree of soil formation. Each order is identified by a word ending in sol. An example is Alfisols.

SUBORDER. Each order is divided into suborders primarily on the basis of properties that influence soil genesis and are important to plant growth or properties that reflect the most important variables within the orders. The last syllable in the name of a suborder indicates the order. An example is Udalfs (Ud, meaning humid, plus alfs, from Alfisols).

GREAT GROUP. Each suborder is divided into great groups on the basis of close similarities in kind, arrangement, and degree of development of pedogenic horizons; soil moisture and temperature regimes; type of saturation; and base status. Each great group is identified by the name of a suborder and by a prefix that indicates a property of the soil. An example is Hapludalfs (Hapl, meaning minimal horizonation, plus udalfs, the suborder of the Alfisols that has a udic moisture regime).

SUBGROUP. Each great group has a typic subgroup. Other subgroups are intergrades or extragrades. The typic subgroup is the central concept of the great group; it is not necessarily the most extensive. Intergrades are transitions to other orders, suborders, or great groups. Extragrades have some properties that are not representative of the great group but do not indicate transitions to any other taxonomic class. Each subgroup is identified by one or more adjectives preceding the name of the great group. The adjective Typic identifies the subgroup that typifies the great group. An example is Typic Hapludalfs.

FAMILY. Families are established within a subgroup on the basis of physical and chemical properties and other characteristics that affect management. Generally, the properties are those of horizons below plow depth where there is much biological activity. Among the properties and characteristics considered are particle-size class, mineralogy class, cation-exchange activity class, soil temperature regime, soil depth, and reaction class. A family name consists of the name of a subgroup preceded by terms that indicate soil properties. An example is fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs.

SERIES. The series consists of soils within a family that have horizons similar in color, texture, structure, reaction, consistence, mineral and chemical composition, and arrangement in the profile.

Crops that require special management are excluded. The soils are grouped according to their limitations for field crops, the risk of damage if they are used for crops, and the way they respond to management. The criteria used in grouping the soils do not include major and generally expensive landforming that would change slope, depth, or other characteristics of the soils, nor do they include possible but unlikely major reclamation projects.

Capability classes, the broadest groups, are designated by the numbers 1 through 8. The numbers indicate progressively greater limitations and narrower choices for practical use. The classes are defined as follows:

Class 1 soils have few limitations that restrict their use.

Class 2 soils have moderate limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require moderate conservation practices.

Class 3 soils have severe limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require special conservation practices, or both.

Class 4 soils have very severe limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require very careful management, or both.

Class 5 soils are subject to little or no erosion but have other limitations, impractical to remove, that restrict their use mainly to pasture, rangeland, forestland, or wildlife habitat.

It also can be used for predicting survival, height, growth, species attributes, and effectiveness and for selecting species for windbreaks, riparian plantings, recreation and wildlife plantings, and ornamental or environmental plantings.

Tree and shrub species associated with each CTSG are broken down by vegetative zones (rainfall zones). These lists are available in the local office of the USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service, or on the Web in the electronic Field Office Technical Guide. Because vegetative zones are rather large, climatic differences within a zone should be considered when species are recommended for planting. For example, some species adapted to the eastern end of a zone may be inadequately adapted to the western end. Care must be taken to ensure that conditions on individual sites are considered when species suitability and performance are determined. A case-by-case decision may be necessary to determine which CTSG is most appropriate when an individual site has characteristics that differ from those of the CTSG in which it occurs. These differences occur because of inclusions of other soils, site modifications (such as leveling and drainage manipulation), soil pH (calcareous sites), irrigation, soil amendments, or other factors."|||"Property"||||0|1|0|0||0|||-1|"ConsTSG"||||||||0|||||0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|7||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""7"">

523|"NH Forest Soil Group"|"mapunit"|"nhiforsoigrp"|"Choice"|254||"NH Forest Soil Groups (NHFSGs) consist of map units that are similar in their potential for commercial forest products, their suitability for native tree growth, and their use and management. Considered in grouping the map units are depth to bedrock, texture, saturated hydraulic conductivity, available water capacity, drainage class, and slope. The grouping applies only to soils in the State of New Hampshire.

The NHFSGs have been developed to help land users and managers in New Hampshire evaluate the relative productivity of soils and to better understand patterns of plant succession and how soil and site interactions influence management decisions. The soils are assigned to one of five groups (IA, IB, IC, IIA, and IIB). Several map units in New Hampshire either vary so greatly or have such a limited potential for commercial forest products that they have not been assigned to an NHFSG (NC). Examples of NC map units are very poorly drained soils and soils at high elevations. The kinds of tree species generally growing in climax stands in each of the five NHFSGs vary from county to county. This information is available through local NRCS field offices. 


IA--This group consists of very deep, loamy, moderately well drained or well drained soils. Generally, these soils are more fertile than other soils and have the most favorable soil moisture relationships. 

IB--The soils in this group are generally sandy or loamy over sandy material and are slightly less fertile than group IA soils.  Group IB soils are moderately well drained or well drained. Their soil moisture is adequate for good tree growth, but it may not be quite as abundant as that in group IA soils. 

IC--The soils in this group are in areas of outwash sand and gravel. They are moderately well to excessively drained. Their soil moisture is adequate for good softwood growth but is limited for hardwoods. 

IIA--This diverse group includes many of the same soils as those in groups IA and IB. The soils are separated into a unique group, however, because they have physical limitations that make forest management more difficult and costly, i.e., steep slopes, bedrock outcrops, erosive textures, surface boulders, and extreme rockiness. 

IIB--The soils in this group are poorly drained. The seasonal high water table is generally within 12 inches of the surface. Productivity is generally less than that of soils in the other groups. 

NC--The map units in this category either vary so greatly or have such a limited potential for commercial forest products that they have not been assigned to an NHFSG. Commonly, onsite visit would be required to evaluate the situation."|||"Property"||||1|0|0|0||0|||-1|"NHFsg"||||||||0||||"Centimeters"|0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|2||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""2""><ColorRampType type=""2"" name=""Defined"" /><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0""><Labels value=""Group IA"" label=""Group IA"" order=""1""><Color red=""0"" green=""176"" blue=""80"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Group IB"" label=""Group IB"" order=""2""><Color red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Group IC"" label=""Group IC"" order=""3""><Color red=""255"" green=""102"" blue=""51"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Group IIA"" label=""Group IIA"" order=""4""><Color red=""153"" green=""102"" blue=""51"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Group IIB"" label=""Group IIB"" order=""5""><Color red=""255"" green=""204"" blue=""102"" /></Labels><Labels value=""NC"" label=""NC"" order=""6""><Color red=""255"" green=""175"" blue=""234"" /></Labels></Legend_Elements></Map_Legend>"|1|11/03/2011 10:24:20|"No Aggregation Necessary"||1|"Choice"
16|"Hydric Rating by Map Unit"|"component"|"hydricrating"|"Choice"|254||"This rating indicates the percentage of map units that meets the criteria for hydric soils. Map units are composed of one or more map unit components or soil types, each of which is rated as hydric soil or not hydric. Map units that are made up dominantly of hydric soils may have small areas of minor nonhydric components in the higher positions on the landform, and map units that are made up dominantly of nonhydric soils may have small areas of minor hydric components in the lower positions on the landform. Each map unit is rated based on its respective components and the percentage of each component within the map unit. 

The thematic map is color coded based on the composition of hydric components. The five color classes are separated as 100 percent hydric components, 66 to 99 percent hydric components, 33 to 65 percent hydric components, 1 to 32 percent hydric components, and less than one percent hydric components.

In Web Soil Survey, the Summary by Map Unit table that is displayed below the map pane contains a column named 'Rating'.  In this column the percentage of each map unit that is classified as hydric is displayed.

Hydric soils are defined by the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils (NTCHS) as soils that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part (Federal Register, 1994). Under natural conditions, these soils are either saturated or inundated long enough during the growing season to support the growth and reproduction of hydrophytic vegetation. 

The NTCHS definition identifies general soil properties that are associated with wetness. In order to determine whether a specific soil is a hydric soil or nonhydric soil, however, more specific information, such as information about the depth and duration of the water table, is needed. Thus, criteria that identify those estimated soil properties unique to hydric soils have been established (Federal Register, 2002). These criteria are used to identify map unit components that normally are associated with wetlands. The criteria used are selected estimated soil properties that are described in ""Soil Taxonomy"" (Soil Survey Staff, 1999) and ""Keys to Soil Taxonomy"" (Soil Survey Staff, 2006) and in the ""Soil Survey Manual"" (Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993). 

If soils are wet enough for a long enough period of time to be considered hydric, they should exhibit certain properties that can be easily observed in the field. These visible properties are indicators of hydric soils. The indicators used to make onsite determinations of hydric soils are specified in ""Field Indicators of Hydric Soils in the United States"" (Hurt and Vasilas, 2006).

2729|"Order of Soil Survey"|"mapunit"|"invesintens"|"Choice"|254||"The Order of a soil survey indicates the level of detail and relative intensity of field observation under which the map unit was developed.  The order of a survey is commonly reflected in the scale of mapping, but not determined by it. Rather, the order of a survey is determined by the field procedures used to identify soil components and place map unit boundaries, the minimum permissible size of map unit delineation, and the kind of map unit to which soil components are aggregated.

Order 1 - Very intensive.  The soils in each delineation are identified by transecting or traversing or even grid mapping. Soil boundaries are observed throughout their length. Remotely sensed data are used as an aid in boundary delineation.  Order 1 surveys are made if very detailed information about soils, generally in small areas, is needed for very intensive land uses.

Order 2 - Intensive.  The soils in each delineation are identified by field observations and by remotely sensed data. Boundaries are verified at closely spaced intervals.  Order 2 surveys are made if detailed information about soil resources is needed to make predictions of soil suitability and treatment needs for intensive land uses. The information can be used in planning for general agriculture, construction, urban development, and similar uses that require precise knowledge of the soils and their variability.

Order 3 - Extensive.  Soil boundaries are plotted by observation and interpretation of remotely sensed data. They are verified by traversing representative areas and by some transects.  Order 3 surveys are made where land uses do not require precise knowledge of small areas or detailed soil information. The survey areas are commonly dominated by a single land use and have few subordinate uses. The soil information can be used in planning for range, forest, and recreational areas and in community planning.

Order 4 - Extensive. Soil boundaries are plotted by interpretation of remotely sensed data. They are verified by traversing representative areas and by some transects.  Order 4 surveys are made if general soil information is needed about the potential and general management of land for extensive uses. The information can be used in locating, comparing, and selecting suitable areas for major kinds of land use, in regional land use planning, and in selecting areas for more intensive study and investigation.

Order 5 - Very extensive.  The soil patterns and composition of map units are determined by mapping representative ideas and like areas by interpretation of remotely sensed data. Soils are verified by some onsite investigation or by traversing. Order 5 surveys are made to collect soil information in very large areas at a level of detail suitable for planning regional land use and interpreting information at a high level of generalization. The primary use of this information is selection of areas for more intensive study.

Some soil survey areas have two or more orders of mapping because they have distinct parts with different needs.  For example, one part may be mapped to make predictions related to irrigation and the other may be mapped to make predictions related to range management. For the irrigated part, areas are mapped at the intensity required for an order 2 soil survey. For the rangeland part, areas are mapped as an order 3 survey.

A taxonomic moisture subclass that is not ""typic"" reflects a taxonomic intergrade or extragrade.  Some soils having a particular moisture regime are transitional to another regime (intergrades) or are grading away from the regime to which they are assigned (extragrades).  An example of an intergrade is an Aquic Haplustalf.  The taxonomic moisture subclass is ""aquic"".  An example of an extragrade is an Aeric Albaqualf.  The taxonomic moisture subclass is ""aeric"".

It is determined for soils that have pH of less than 5.5. Soils having a low cation-exchange capacity (CEC) hold fewer cations and may require more frequent applications of fertilizer than soils having a high cation-exchange capacity. The ability to retain cations reduces the hazard of ground-water pollution. Effective CEC is a measure of CEC that is particularly useful in areas where the ion-exchange capacity of the soil is largely a result of variable charge components, such as allophane, kaolinite, hydrous iron and aluminum oxides, and organic matter, which result in a CEC that is not a fixed number but a function of pH.

It is assumed that the soil is not insulated by vegetation or snow and is not artificially drained. Silty and highly structured, clayey soils that have a high water table in winter are the most susceptible to frost action. Well drained, very gravelly, or very sandy soils are the least susceptible.

Soils are assigned to one of four groups according to the rate of water infiltration when the soils are not protected by vegetation, are thoroughly wet, and receive precipitation from long-duration storms.

The soils in the United States are assigned to four groups (A, B, C, and D) and three dual classes (A/D, B/D, and C/D). The groups are defined as follows:

Group A. Soils having a high infiltration rate (low runoff potential) when thoroughly wet. These consist mainly of deep, well drained to excessively drained sands or gravelly sands. These soils have a high rate of water transmission.

Group B. Soils having a moderate infiltration rate when thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of moderately deep or deep, moderately well drained or well drained soils that have moderately fine texture to moderately coarse texture. These soils have a moderate rate of water transmission.

Group C. Soils having a slow infiltration rate when thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of soils having a layer that impedes the downward movement of water or soils of moderately fine texture or fine texture. These soils have a slow rate of water transmission.

Group D. Soils having a very slow infiltration rate (high runoff potential) when thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of clays that have a high shrink-swell potential, soils that have a high water table, soils that have a claypan or clay layer at or near the surface, and soils that are shallow over nearly impervious material. These soils have a very slow rate of water transmission.

If a soil is assigned to a dual hydrologic group (A/D, B/D, or C/D), the first letter is for drained areas and the second is for undrained areas.

Conditions that increase the hazard of slippage but are not considered in this rating are undercutting lower portions or loading the upper parts of a slope or altering the drainage or offsite water contribution to the site, such as through irrigation.  

Slippage is an important consideration for engineering practices, such as constructing roads and buildings, and for forestry practices.

Soil slippage potential classes are estimated by observing slope; lithology, including contrasting lithologies; strike and dip; surface drainage patterns; and occurrences of such features as slip scars and slumps.

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen. An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as listed for the map unit. The percent composition of each component in a particular map unit is presented to help the user better understand the percentage of each map unit that has the rating presented.  

Other components with different ratings may be present in each map unit. The ratings for all components, regardless of the map unit aggregated rating, can be viewed by generating the equivalent report from the Soil Reports tab in Web Soil Survey. Onsite investigation may be needed to validate these interpretations and to confirm the identity of the soil on a given site.

2746|"AASHTO Group Index"|"chorizon"|"aashind_r"|"Integer"|||"The AASHTO Group Index is a refinement to the seven major groups of the AASHTO soil classification system.  According to
this system, soil is classified into seven major groups: A -l through A-7. Soils classified into groups A-1, A-2. and A-3 are granular materials of which 35% or less of the particles pass through the No. 200 sieve. Soils of which more than 35% pass through the No. 200 sieve are classified into groups A-4, A-5, A-6, and A-7. These soils are mostly silt and clay-type materials.  

The classifications system is based on the following criteria:
1. Grain size
a. Gravel ; fraction passing the 75-mm( 3-in.) sieve and retained on the No. 10 (2-mm) U.S. sieve
b. sand: fraction passing the No. 10 (2-mm) U.S. sieve and retained on the No.200 (0.075-mm) U.S. sieve
c. Silt and clay: fraction passing the No. 200 U.S. sieve

2. Plasticity The term silty is applied when the fine fractions of the soil have a plasticity index of 10 or less. The term clayey is applied when the fine fractions have a plasticity index of 11 or more.
3. If cobbles and boulders (size larger than 75 mm) are encountered, they are excluded from the portion of the soil sample from which classification is made.

To evaluate the quality of a soil as a highway subgrade material, one must also incorporate a number called the group index (GI) with the groups and subgroups of the soil. This index is written in parentheses after the group or subgroup designation.
The group index is given by the equation:

GI = (F200-35)[0.2+ 0.005(LL- 40)] + 0.01(.F200-15)(PI- 10) 

where:
F200 = percentage passing through the No. 200 sieve
LL -- liquid limit
PI : plasticity index

The group index is used typically to refine an AASHTO class but in the soil survey database is often used as a standalone soil attribute.

For each soil layer, this attribute is actually recorded as three separate values in the database. A low value and a high value indicate the range of this attribute for the soil component. A ""representative"" value indicates the expected value of this attribute for the component.

There are many types of restrictions that can occur within the soil profile but this theme only includes the three restrictions that use the term bedrock.  These are:

1)	Lithic Bedrock
2)	Paralithic Bedrock
3)	Densic Bedrock

Lithic bedrock and paralithic bedrock are comprised of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks, which are coherent and consolidated into rock through pressure, heat, cementation, or fusion. Lithic bedrock represents the hardest type of bedrock, with a hardness of strongly coherent to indurated. Paralithic bedrock has a hardness of extremely weakly coherent to moderately coherent. It can occur as a thin layer of weathered bedrock above harder lithic bedrock. Paralithic bedrock can also be much thicker, extending well below the soil profile. 

Densic bedrock represents a unique kind of bedrock recognized within the soil survey. It is non-coherent and consolidated, dense root restrictive material, formed by pressure, heat, and dewatering of earth materials or sediments. Densic bedrock differs from densic materials, which formed under the compaction of glaciers, mudflows, and or human-caused compaction.

If more than one type of bedrock is described for an individual soil type, the depth to the shallowest one is given. If no bedrock is described in a map unit, it is represented by the ""greater than 200"" depth class.

Depth to bedrock is actually recorded as three separate values in the database. A low value and a high value indicate the range of this attribute for the soil component. A ""representative"" value indicates the expected value of this attribute for the component. For this soil property, only the representative value is used.

2647|"Soil Health - Organic Matter"|"chorizon"|"om_r"|"Float"||2|"Organic matter percent is the weight of decomposed plant, animal, and microbial residues exclusive of non-decomposed plant and animal residues. It is expressed as a percentage, by weight, of the soil material that is less than 2 mm in diameter.

Significance:
Soil organic matter (SOM) influences the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils far more than suggested by its relatively small proportion in most soils. The organic fraction influences plant growth through its influence on these soil properties. It encourages soil aggregation, especially macroaggregation, increases porosity, and lowers bulk density. Because the soil structure is improved, water infiltration rates increase. SOM has a high capacity to adsorb and exchange cations and is important to pesticide binding. It furnishes energy to microorganisms in the soil. As SOM is decomposed by soil microbes, it releases nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur, and many micronutrients, which become available for plant growth. SOM is a heterogeneous, dynamic substance that varies in particle size, carbon content, decomposition rate, and turnover time. In general, the content of SOM is highest at the surface—where plant, animal, and microbial residue inputs are greatest—and decreases with depth. 

Total organic carbon (TOC) is the carbon (C) stored in SOM. Total organic carbon is also referred to as soil organic carbon (SOC) in the scientific literature. Organic carbon enters the soil through the decomposition of plant and animal residues, root exudates, and living and dead microorganisms. Inorganic carbon is common in calcareous soils in the form of calcium and magnesium carbonates. In calcareous soils, the content of inorganic carbon can exceed TOC.

Factors Affecting Content of SOM and SOC:

Inherent factors - Soil texture, parent material, drainage, climate, and time affect accumulation of SOM. Soils that are rich in clay have greater capacity to protect SOM from decomposition by stabilizing substances that bind to clay surfaces. The formation of soil aggregates—enabled by the presence of clay, aluminum and iron oxides, fungal hyphae, bacterial exudates (carbohydrates), and fine roots—protects SOM from microbial decomposition. Extractable aluminum and allophanes, which are present in volcanic soils, can react with SOM to form compounds that are stable and resist microbial decomposition. Warm temperatures increase decomposition rates of SOM. High mean annual precipitation increases accumulation rates of SOM by stimulating the production of plant biomass. 

Loss of SOM through erosion results in SOM variations along slope gradients. Areas of level topography tend to have much more SOM than areas with other slope classes. Both elevation and topographic gradients affect local climate, vegetation distribution, and soil properties. They also affect associated biogeochemical processes, including SOM dynamics. Analysis of factors affecting C in the conterminous United States indicates that the effects of land use, topography (elevation and slope), and mean annual precipitation on SOM are more obvious than the effects of mean annual temperature. However, when other variables are highly restricted, SOM content clearly declines with increasing temperature.

Dynamic factors - Dynamic gains and losses in SOM are due primarily to management decisions in combination with climate and microbial influences. Accumulation of SOM is controlled by the rate of C mineralization, the amount and stage of decomposition of plant residues, and the addition of organic amendments to soil.

Soil organic carbon comprises approximately 52 to 58% of the SOM and is the main source of energy for soil microorganisms. The C within plant residues, particulate organic matter, and soil microbial biomass is generally considered to be within the active pool of SOM. The emergent view of SOM focuses on microbial access to SOM and includes an emphasis on the need to manage C flows rather than discrete C pools. During decomposition of SOM, energy and nutrients are released and utilized by plant roots and soil biota. Recognizing that SOM is a continuum of decomposition products is a first step in designing management strategies for renewing SOM sources throughout the year.

Soil aggregates of various sizes and stabilities can act as sites at which SOM is physically protected from decomposition and C mineralization. Soil disturbance and aggregate destruction increase biodegradation of SOM. Aggregates are readily broken apart by tillage operations.

Crop residues incorporated into or left on the soil surface reduce erosion and the losses of SOM associated with sediment. In acidic soils, applications of lime increase plant productivity, microbial activity, organic matter decomposition, and CO2 release.

The diversity of the soil microbial population affects SOM. For example, while soil bacteria and some fungi participate in SOM loss by mineralizing C compounds, other fungi, such as mycorrhizae, facilitate stabilization and physical protection by aggregating SOM with clay and minerals. SOM is better protected from degradation within aggregates than in free-form. 

Relationship to Soil Function:
SOM is one of the most important soil constituents. It affects plant growth by improving aggregate stability, soil structure, water availability, and nutrient cycling. SOM fractions in the active pool, described above, are the main source of energy and nutrients for soil microorganisms, which mediate nutrient cycling in the soil. Biochemically stable SOM participates in aggregate stability and in holding capacity for nutrients and water.

Microaggregates are formed by mineral interactions with iron and aluminum oxides and are generally considered an inherent soil characteristic. They are, however, impacted by current and past management. Fine roots, fungal hyphae, and organic carbon compounds, such as complex sugars (carbohydrates) and proteins (also referred to as glues), bind mineral particles and microaggregates together to form macroaggregates that are still porous enough to allow air, water, and plant roots to move through the soil.

An increase in SOM leads to greater biological diversity and activity in the soil, thus increasing biological control of plant diseases and pests.

Problems Associated with Low Organic Matter Levels:
Low levels of SOM result in energy-source shortages and thereby lowered levels of microbial biomass, activity, and nutrient mineralization. In noncalcareous soils, aggregate stability, infiltration, drainage, and airflow are also reduced. Scarcity of SOM results in less diversity in soil biota and a risk of disruption to the food chain equilibrium. This disruption can cause disturbance in the soil environment (e.g., increased plant pests and diseases and accumulation of toxic substances).

Improving SOM Levels:
An estimated 4.4x10 to the 9th power tons of C have been lost from soils of the United States due to traditional farming practices. Most of this carbon was SOC. Nearly half of the SOM has been lost from many agricultural soils. Other farming practices, such as no-till and cover cropping (especially when used together), can stop losses of SOM and even lead to increases. Continuous application of manure and compost can increase SOM. Burning, harvesting, or otherwise removing plant residues decreases SOM.

Measurement:
SOM is measured in the laboratory by determining total carbon (TC) content using either dry or wet-dry combustion. Current analytical methods do not distinguish between decomposed and nondecomposed residues, so soil is first sieved to 2 mm to remove as much of the recognizable plant material as possible. If no carbonates are present, TC is considered to be the same as TOC (or SOC). For calcareous soils, soil inorganic carbon in the form carbonates must also be measured and then subtracted from the TC to determine TOC content. Results are given as the percent TOC in dry soil. To convert percent TOC to percent SOM, multiply the TOC percentage by 1.724. To convert percent SOM to percent TOC, divide the SOM percentage by 1.724. Note that this value continues to be debated by researchers with possible values ranging from 1.4 to 2.5 (Pribyl, 2010). A conversion factor of 2 has been suggested for this database but has not yet been adopted. Detailed procedures for measurement of SOM are outlined in 'Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 42, Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory Methods Manual, Version 5.0,' (Soil Survey Staff, 2014).

Many soil testing laboratories use a 'loss on ignition' method to estimate soil organic matter. The estimate produced by this method must be correlated to analytical TOC measurements for each area to improve accuracy. The loss on ignition method can provide a good indication of the trend in SOM content within a field. It is important to note that temperature and timing used for the loss on ignition approach vary across labs and can influence results. Thus, comparisons should be made using only results from within a given lab.

Currently, no standard method exists to measure TOC in the field. Attempts have been made to develop charts that match color to TOC content, but the correlation is better within soil landscapes and only for limited soils. Near-infrared spectroscopy has been tested for measuring C directly in the field, but it is expensive and sensitive to moisture content.

Estimates:
Color and feel are soil characteristics that can be used to estimate SOM content. Color comparisons in areas of similar parent materials and textures can be correlated with laboratory data and thereby enable a soil scientist to make field estimates. In general, darker colors or black indicate the presence of higher amounts of organic matter. The contrast of color between the A horizon and subsurface horizons is also a good indicator. Sandy soils tend to look darker with a lower content of SOM. In general, lower numbers for hue, value, and chroma (in the Munsell soil color system) tend to be associated with darker soil colors that are attributed to higher content of SOM, soil moisture, or both.

For each soil layer, this attribute is actually recorded as three separate values in the database. A low value and a high value indicate the range of this attribute for the soil component. A 'representative' value indicates the expected value of this attribute for the component. For this soil property, only the representative value is used.

2755|"Soil Health - Available Water Capacity"|"chorizon"|"awc_r"|"Float"||2|"Available water capacity (AWC) refers to the quantity of water that the soil is capable of storing for use by plants. It is expressed in centimeters of water per centimeter of soil for each soil layer.

Significance:
Available water capacity is an indicator of a soil’s ability to retain water and make it sufficiently available for plant use. In areas where daily rainfall is insufficient to meet plant needs, the capacity of soil to store water is very important (USDA-NRCS, 2008). Water held in the soil is needed to sustain plants between rainfall or irrigation events and provide a buffer against periods of water deficit. The capacity varies, depending on soil properties that affect retention of water. The most important properties are the content of organic matter, soil texture, bulk density, and soil structure, with corrections for salinity and rock fragments. Available water capacity determinations are used to develop water budgets, predict droughtiness, design and operate irrigation systems, design drainage systems, protect water resources, and predict yields (Lowery et al., 1996). They also are an important factor in the choice of plants or crops to be grown. The available water capacity can be increased by applying soil management that maximizes the soil’s inherent capacity to store water. Improving soil structure and ameliorating compacted zones can improve both the storage capacity of the soil itself and increase the depth to which plant roots can penetrate.

Factors Affecting Available Water Capacity:

Inherent factors.—Available water capacity is affected by soil texture, amount of rock fragments, and a soil’s depth and layers. It is primarily controlled by soil texture and structure. Soils with higher silt contents generally have higher available water capacities, while sandy soils have the lowest available water capacities.  Rock fragments reduce a soil’s available water capacity proportionate to their volume, unless the rocks are porous. Soil depth and root-restricting layers affect the total available water capacity since they can limit the volume of soil available for root growth. 

Dynamic factors.—Available water capacity is affected by soil organic matter, compaction, and salt concentrations. Organic matter can increase a soil’s capacity to store water, on average, equivalent to its weight in available water (Libohova et al., 2018). Indirectly, organic matter improves soil structure and aggregate stability, resulting in increased pore size and volume. These soil improvements result in increased infiltration and movement of water through the soil. Greater amounts of water entering the soil can then be used by plant roots. Compaction reduces the available water capacity by reducing the total pore volume. Soils with high salt concentrations have a reduced available water capacity. Solutes in soil water attract water (osmotic potential), making it difficult for plant roots to extract or uptake the water.

Measurement:
Available water capacity is determined in the lab by measuring the water content at field capacity (33 kPa) and wilting point (1500 kPa) and calculating the difference (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). Pressure plates or membranes are used to bring the soil sample to a desired matric potential (33 kPa or 1500 kPa). When at equilibrium, the soil sample is removed and dried to determine its water content.

2756|"Soil Health - Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR)"|"chorizon"|"sar_r"|"Float"||1|"The sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) is a measure of the amount of sodium (Na) relative to calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) in the water extract from a saturated soil paste. It is the ratio of the Na concentration divided by the square root of one-half of the Ca + Mg concentration. It is a diagnostic parameter for the sodicity hazard of a soil. 

Significance: 
When SAR is greater than 13, the soil is considered a sodic soil. Sodic soils have excessive levels of sodium (Na) adsorbed on the cation-exchange sites of clays. In other words, they have a high exchangeable sodium percentage. In addition, these soils are low in total salts. The sodium causes the soil particles to repel each other and, as a result, the soil disperses. This process prevents the formation of soil aggregates and degrades soil structure. The dispersed physical condition results in poor water infiltration, the formation of surface crusts, and the restriction of water and air movement through soil, and it restricts seedling emergence and root growth. Also, there is increased dispersion of organic matter. Soil management on sodic soils should aim to preserve or increase soil organic matter in the surface soil, which increases infiltration and water movement through the soil (Diaz and Presley, 2017). Maintaining good drainage and low ground-water levels is important. In the reclamation process of sodic soils, the excessive sodium is replaced by calcium supplements before the leaching process begins (NDSU, 2018).

Factors Affecting Sodium Adsorption Ratio:

Inherent factors.—Sodium or salts in the soils may originate from various natural sources, such as in-situ weathering of minerals and rocks (both terrestrial and marine origin), contributions from groundwater, deposition of materials containing sodium, and deposition or intrusion of sea water (Zia-ur-Rehaman et al., 2017). Atmospheric sources involve aeolian transport of salts, incorporation of marine salts into water vapor, and then inland precipitation (Chartres, 1993). Following this, the sodium either accumulates in the soil or is removed from the soil, depending on environmental conditions. If rainfall is insufficient to leach naturally occurring salts, they will accumulate in the soil.

Dynamic factors.—Soils may become sodic or the sodic condition may worsen as a result of land use, including the use of irrigation water with elevated levels of sodium. Use of surface or ground water containing dissolved salts for irrigation adds salts to the soils. Irrigating from salt-impacted wells or saline industrial water may lead to the formation of saline soils (Sonon et al., 2015).

Measurement:
The saturated paste method (Soil Survey Staff, 2014) is used to measure SAR. It provides the best representative measurement of total soluble salts in the soil solution under field conditions. The saturated soil paste is prepared in the lab, an aqueous extract is obtained from the paste, and the salt cations are determined from the extract.

Chemically, it is a measurement of the hydrogen ion activity [H+] in the soil solution. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14; a pH of 7 is considered neutral. If pH values are greater than 7, the solution is considered basic or alkaline; if they are below 7, the solution is acidic. 

Significance:
The acidity or alkalinity of a soil affects the availability of plant nutrients, the activity of microorganisms, and the solubility of soil minerals (Brady, 1990). In general, pH values between 6 and 7.5 are optimum for general crop growth. Site-specific interpretations for soil health will depend on specific land uses and crop tolerances. In acid soils, calcium and magnesium, nitrate-nitrogen, phosphorus, boron, and molybdenum are deficient but aluminum and manganese are abundant, in some cases at levels toxic to some plants (USDA-NRCS, 2008). Phosphorus, iron, copper, zinc, and boron are frequently deficient in very alkaline soils. Bacterial populations and activity decline at low pH levels, whereas fungi adapt to a large range of pH (acidic and alkaline). Nitrification and nitrogen fixation are also inhibited by low pH (USDA-NRCS, 2008). To increase pH, liming, adding organic residues rich in basic cations, and rotating crops to interrupt the acidifying effect of leguminous crops are effective. Applying ammonium-based fertilizers, urea, sulfur, or ferrous sulfate; irrigating with acidifying fertilizers; or using acidifying residues (acid moss, pine needles, sawdust) decrease soil pH (USDA-NRCS, 2008). 

Factors Affecting Soil Reaction:

Inherent factors.—The natural soil pH reflects the combined effects of climate, vegetation, topography, parent material, and time. Temperature and rainfall are two major factors that control the intensity of leaching and soil mineral weathering. Acidity is generally associated with leached soils, and alkalinity is generally associated with soils in drier regions. In arid climates, soil weathering and leaching are less intense, cations accumulate, and the soil becomes neutral or alkaline. In soils where the pH is less than 5, aluminum becomes soluble and reacts with water to produce hydrogen ions. Sandy soils may acidify more easily compared to clay soils because they have a low buffering capacity and tend to leach more readily. Vegetation has an effect on soil pH through the type of organic matter that is added; certain types of vegetation are soil acidifying (USDA-NRCS, 2008). 

Dynamic factors.—The conversion of uncultivated land into cropland can result in drastic pH changes after a few years. These changes are caused by the removal of cations by crops, the acceleration of leaching, the effect of fertilizers and amendments, and the variations in organic matter content and soil buffering capacity (USDA-NRCS, 2008). Inorganic amendments (lime and gypsum) and organic amendments rich in cations increase soil pH. Ammonium from organic matter mineralization (nitrification), ammonium-based fertilizers, and sulfur compounds lower the pH. High rates of water percolation and infiltration can increase the leaching of cations and accelerate soil acidification.

Measurement:
The pH reported here is measured using the 1:1 soil to water ratio method (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). A crushed soil sample is mixed with an equal amount of water, and the pH of the suspension is measured.

2758|"Soil Health - Surface Texture"|"chtexturegrp"|"texdesc"|"Narrative Text"|||"Soil texture, or how the soil looks and feels, is determined by the size and proportion of the particles (clay, silt, and sand) that make up the mineral fraction. There are 12 USDA textural classes (e.g., sandy loam, silty clay). 

Significance:
The textural class of a soil is its most fundamental inherent characteristic that changes little over time (van Es et al., 2016). Its role in soil health studies is to inform the interpretation of most of the soil health indicators. Numerous soil properties are influenced by texture, including drainage, water-holding capacity, water movement through soil, infiltration, susceptibility to erosion, organic matter content, cation-exchange capacity, pH buffering capacity, and aeration. Soil texture also influences soil fertility, root growth, and plant vigor.

Factors Affecting Soil Surface Texture:

Inherent factors.—The nature and composition of the soil parent material greatly influences the particle-size distribution, or texture. Weathering of rocks and soil materials also affect the soil texture. Clays typically form over long periods of time through gradual chemical weathering. Freeze-thaw action can break apart rocks and gradually reduce the particle size of soil materials over time. Translocation of soil particles (e.g., clay) within the profile and between layers can alter the soil texture. Additions of particles by wind or water also affect the soil texture.

Dynamic factors.—Soil texture is altered little by management practices if the soil remains in place. Accelerated erosion by wind or water can remove the topsoil, exposing a subsoil with a different texture. Deposition of eroded materials can alter the texture of the surface soil. Deposition can be natural or anthropogenic (due to human activity). Land leveling and alteration (e.g., terracing) can change the soil texture.

Measurement:
The feel method is a crude method by which one can broadly judge the classes of soil texture. The lab methods involve removal of organic matter from a soil sample, the dispersion of the soil sample into single particles, and then the separation of sand through sieving. Clay is determined through sedimentation based on Stoke’s law. The full procedure is described in the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory Methods Manual (Soil Survey Staff, 2014).

2759|"Soil Health - Bulk Density, One-Third Bar"|"chorizon"|"dbthirdbar_r"|"Float"||2|"Bulk density, one-third bar is the oven-dry weight of the soil material less than 2 millimeters in size per unit volume of soil at a water tension of 1/3 bar (33 kPa). It indicates the density of the soil and is expressed in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cc) of soil material. 

Significance:
Bulk density is one of several soil properties frequently used as a measure of soil health (Volchko et al., 2014) and as an indicator of soil compaction and root restriction. It reflects the soil’s capacity to provide structural support, water and solute movement, and soil aeration (Arshad et al., 1996). Even though bulk density varies with soil texture, it is a dynamic soil property that also varies depending on the structural condition of the soil. It can be altered by cultivation, trampling by animals, compaction by agricultural machinery, and raindrop impact (Arshad et al., 1996). Any soil management that alters the soil cover, the amount of organic matter, soil structure, or porosity will affect soil bulk density (USDA-NRCS, 2008). A dense soil will restrict root growth and seedling emergence, reduce the available water capacity, restrict water and air movement, and ultimately reduce productivity. Management that improves soil bulk density includes reducing soil disturbance when the soil is wet, applying conservation practices that increase or maintain soil organic matter contents, and maintaining soil surface protection (such as a cover crop, especially a multi-species cover that can provide a wide range of root penetration).

Measurement of bulk density is essential for weight to volume or area conversions of other properties, such as soil carbon stocks and nutrient pools. It is also used in the calculation of pore space.

Factors Affecting Bulk Density:

Inherent factors.—Bulk density is dependent on soil texture and the densities of soil mineral particles (sand, silt, and clay) and organic matter particles, as well as their packing arrangement. Generally, loose, porous soils and those rich in organic matter have lower bulk densities. Sandy soils have relatively high bulk densities since total pore space in sands is less than that of silty or clayey soils. Finer-textured soils that have good structure, such as silt loams and clay loams, have higher pore space and lower bulk density compared to sandy soils.

There is a general relationship of soil bulk density to root growth based on soil texture. Bulk densities ideal for root growth are less than 1.60 g/cc for sandy textures, less than 1.40 g/cc for loamy textures, and less than 1.10 g/cc for clayey textures. Bulk densities that restrict root growth are greater than 1.80 g/cc for sandy textures, 1.65 g/cc for loamy textures, and 1.47 g/cc for clayey textures.

Dynamic factors.—Bulk density is changed by crop and land management practices that affect soil cover, organic matter, soil structure, and/or porosity. Cultivation can result in compacted soil layers with increased bulk density. Livestock as well as the use of agricultural and construction equipment can compact the soil and reduce porosity, especially on wet soils. Freeze-thaw action in the soil can lead to lowered bulk density.

Measurement:
In general, there are two broad groupings of bulk density methods. One group is for soil materials that are cohesive enough that a field sample can be removed, and the other group is for soils that are too fragile for field sampling and require an excavation operation. In methods for the former group, a clod sample is coated with a plastic film and the volume determined by submergence. There are also various core methods for the former group in which a cylinder of known volume is used to obtain a sample. The detailed procedures are outlined in the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory Methods Manual (Soil Survey Staff, 2014).
