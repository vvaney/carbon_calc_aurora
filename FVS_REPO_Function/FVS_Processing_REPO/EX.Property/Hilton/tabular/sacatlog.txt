This data set consists of general soil association units. It was
developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey and supersedes
the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) data set published in 2006.
It consists of a broad based inventory of soils and nonsoil areas
that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can
be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. The data set was
created by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more
detailed soil survey maps were not available, data on geology,
topography, vegetation, and climate were assembled, together with
Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas
were studied, and the probable classification and extent of the soils
were determined.

Map unit composition was determined by transecting or sampling areas
on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to
characterize the whole map unit.

This data set consists of georeferenced vector digital data and
tabular digital data. The map data were collected in 1-by 2-degree
topographic quadrangle units and merged into a seamless national
data set. It is distributed in state/territory and national extents.
The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil
Information System data base which gives the proportionate extent of
the component soils and their properties.
</abstract><purpose>
These data provide information about soil features on or near the
surface of the Earth. Data were collected as part of the National
Cooperative Soil Survey. These data are intended for geographic
display and analysis at the state, regional, and national level.
The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for
1:250,000-scale data.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation
Service should be acknowledged as the data source in products
derived from these data. Hardcopies utilizing these data shall
clearly indicate their source. User agrees not to misrepresent these
data, nor to imply that changes made were approved by the Natural
Resources Conservation Service.

The Digital General Soil Map of U.S. was designed primarily for
regional, multicounty, river basin, State, and multistate resource
planning, management, and monitoring. Data are not detailed enough
to make interpretations at a county level. This soil survey product
is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting
or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference source. The use
of these data is not restricted and may be interpreted by organizations,
agencies, units of government, or others; however, they are responsible
for its appropriate application. Federal, State, or local regulatory
bodies are not to reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation
Service any authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural
Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of
these maps for purposes related solely to state or local regulatory
programs.

When data from the Digital General Soil Map of U.S. are overlayed
with other data layers, such as land use data, caution must be
used in generating statistics on the co-occurence of the land use
data with the soil data. The composition of the soil map unit can
be characterized independently for the land use and for the soil
component, but there are no data on their joint occurrence at a
more detailed level. Analysis of the overlayed data should be on a
map polygon basis.

Additional political, watershed, or other boundaries may be
intersected with the soil data. Although the composition of each
political and watershed unit may be described in terms of the
soil map units, information is not available to assign the
components to the boundary units with full accuracy. As with the
land use categories, the analysis should be restricted to the
classified components.

The approximate minimum area delineated is 625 hectares
(1,544 acres), which is represented on a 1:250,000-scale map by
an area approximately 1 cm by 1 cm (0.4 inch by 0.4 inch).
The approximate minimum area delineated for Alaska is 2,500 hectares
(6,176 acres), which is represented on a 1:5000,000-scale map by
an area approximately 1 cm by 1 cm (0.4 inch by 0.4 inch).Linear
delineations are not less than 0.5 cm (0.2 inch) in width. The
number of delineations per 1:250,000 quadrangle typically is 100
to 200, but may range up to 400. Delineations depict the dominant
soils making up the landscape. Other dissimilar soils, too small
to be delineated, are present within a delineation.

Digital enlargements of these data to scales greater than at
which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation
of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of
contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale.
The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis
derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling,
testing, and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses.
Thus, these data and their interpretations are intended for
planning purposes only.

Data values for some data elements may be incomplete or missing.
Where data are unavailable, a mask should be used to exclude the
area from analysis.

The spatial and tabular data used to create this product are
periodically updated. Data are versioned, and users are responsible
for obtaining the latest version of the product.

Accuracy is tested by manual comparison of the source with hard
copy plots and/or symbolized display of the map data on an
interactive computer graphic system. Selected  attributes that
cannot be visually verified on plots or on screen are interactively
queried and verified on screen. In addition, the attributes
are tested against a master set of valid attributes. All attribute
data conform to the attribute codes in the signed classification
and correlation document and amendments and are current as of
the date of digitizing.
</attraccr></attracc><logic>
Certain node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain
relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological
requirements. (The GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation).
Some of these requirements include: chains must begin and end at
nodes, chains must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not
extend through nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for
each chain element and are consistent throughout, and the chains
representing the limits of the file (neatline) are free of gaps.
The tests of logical consistency are performed using vendor
software. The neatline is generated by connecting the explicitly
entered four corners of the digital file. All data outside the
enclosed region are ignored and all data crossing these
geographically straight lines are clipped at the neatline. Data
within a specified tolerance of the neatline are snapped to the
neatline. Neatline straightening aligns the digitized edges of
the digital data with the generated neatline (i.e., with the
longitude/latitude lines in geographic coordinates). All internal
polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are
checked on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil
lines (i.e., adjacent polygons with the same label). Quadrangles
are edge matched within the state, merged into a statewide data
sets, and then edge matched to adjacent state data sets. Edge
locations do not deviate from centerline to centerline by more
than 0.01 inch.

A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named the same
in terms of their soil and/or nonsoil areas. Each map unit differs
in some respect from all others in a survey area and is uniquely
identified. Each individual area is a delineation. Each map unit
in the Digital General Soil Map of U.S. consists of one to more
than 21 components.

In those few areas where detailed maps did not exist,
reconnaissance soil surveys were combined with data on geology,
topography, vegetation, climate, and remote sensing images to
delineate map units and estimate the percentages of components.
Map unit components in this product are soil series phases, and
their percent composition represents the estimated areal proportion
of each within a map unit. The composition for a map unit is
generalized to represent the statewide extent of that map unit
and not the extent of any single map unit delineation. These
specifications provide a nationally consistent representation of
the associated attribute data.

The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
delineations were based on statistical analysis of transect data.
The composition was largely determined by measuring transects on
detailed soil survey maps. The number of transects used was
proportional to the relative size, number, and complexity of the
delineations. The combined data on the length of the map units
crossed by the transects were used to determine the percentages
of the different soil and nonsoil areas in each map unit.

Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey Standards and
procedures were used in the classification of soils, design and
name of map units. These standards are outlined in U.S. Department
of Agriculture. 2nd Ed., 1999. Soil Taxonomy: A basic system of
soil classification for making and interpreting soil surveys.

Adherence to National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and
procedures is based on peer review, quality control, and quality
assurance. Quality control is outlined in documents that reside
with the Natural Resources Conservation Service state soil
scientist.

The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their
compilation to base maps that meet National Map Accuracy
Standards. The difference in positional accuracy between
the map unit boundaries in the field and their digitized
map locations is unknown. The locational acuracy of soil
delineations on the ground varies with the transition
between map units.

For example, in areas where changes in soils, climate,
topography, and geology occur subtly across a portion of a
state, the transition between soil map unit boundaries will
be gradual. Where these features change abruptly, such as
from an area of foothills to a lake plain, the transition
will be very narrow. Soil delineation boundaries were
digitized within 0.01 inches of their locations on the
digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched
between data sets. The data along each state boundary are
matched against the data for the adjacent state. Edge
locations generally do not deviate from centerline to
centerline by more than 0.01 inch.

Soil map unit lines and symbols were drafted in red pencil

The soil delineation overlays were raster scanned at a
scanning resolution of at least 0.01 inches and converted to
a vector format or were manually digitized on a digitizing
tablet with a resolution of at least 0.001 inches. Four
control points corresponding to the four corners of the

The Alaska soils staff updated the STATSGO mapping for the state.

A limited number of field visits during the summers of 2009 and 2010
provided additional verification of the preliminary STATSGO map.
This included over 150 pedon and plant community descriptions completed
as a cooperative effort with USDI-US Fish and Wildlife Service and
the Bureau of Land Management.  Several National Wildlife Refuges
were visited including Alaska Maritime (Attu Island), Yukon Delta,
Kanuti, Tetlin, and Togiak.  In addition the Bureau of Land Management
supported verification work on the North Slope between Galbraith Lake
and the Colville River Delta.  In addition, 57 soil investigations
of communities throughout Alaska are used to refine and verify the map.

The state-wide Alaska MLRA (2002) map provided a starting point for
this STATSGO update.  STATSGO map units are unique to a MLRA.
The map unit composition is derived through two different processes.

In areas of detailed soil survey information (SSURGO) map units
are developed through the aggregation of detailed soil maps into
more general delineations with composition estimates based on
a weighted average of detailed map unit components.

Since detailed soil information is available for only about 15 percent
of Alaska, a remote sensing approach using GIS tools was necessary
to develop map units and components for remaining areas.

The remote sensing process used to derive a majority of the STATSGO map
for Alaska is described in the following paragraphs and outline.
Regardless of the availability of detailed SSURGO data, a similar landform
and life zone approach to map unit development is used in order to achieve
a uniform map product throughout the State.

The soil map unit lines and symbols are produced through a digitized
on-screen process at a scale of approximately 1:250,000 in order
to minimize the angularity of vertices and improve line placement
and accuracy at landform boundaries.

The final map is published at a nominal scale of 1:500,000.
The on-screen digitizing process is best described as
a visual digitizing process using a variety of digital layers
as tools to assist in the manual on-screen process.

Map Unit Delineations are closed polygons that are geographic
mixtures of groups of soils or soils and nonsoil areas.

The map unit key uniquely identifies each closed map unit
delineation. Each map unit key is linked to a map unit symbol
and a map unit name. The map unit key is also the key for linking
information in the National Soil Information System tables.

Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil
Information System data base. This attribute data base gives the
proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties
for each soil. The data base contains both estimated and measured
data on the physical and chemical soil properties.

The National Soil Information System data base contains static
metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such
